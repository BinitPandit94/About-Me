My name is Binit Kumar Pandit. I'm currently working with Prof. [Ayan Banerjee](https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/Faculty/telecom-ayan/) towards my Doctoral Degree at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, [IIEST Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/).
One of my research interests is VLSI Architecture Design for Machine Learning Applications. It is an exciting field to work upon as millions of ideas come out every day.
